# Pull Request Title Checker

This is a fork of the github https://github.com/thehanimo/pr-title-checker for checking the _title_ of a PR.
The fork supports to use it for for organization-wide actions.

## Usage for organization-wide action


### Usage

This repo contains a github action.
Its config is embedded in the `Ã¬ndex.js` file.

To use it in your organization requires two steps:
1. create a repo containing a _(github action) workflow yaml file_: https://github.com/emnify/github-action-pr-title-lint/blob/main/.github%20/workflows/pr-title-lint-blocking.yml
2. reference this file in the global config of your github enterprise under https://github.com/organizations/myorg/settings/actions "Required workflows"


### Release Process

If changes to the action or its config are required please proceed as follows:
1. commit and push your changes
2. perform `npm prepare`and commit adn push the changes in the `dist` folder
3. create a tag for this version -- no need to create a release !
4. in the workflow file reference the new version number

## Standard Usage

In your target repository create two files.

#### Create config file

Create a config file `.github/pr-title-checker-config.json` like this one below:

```json
{
  "LABEL": {
    "name": "title needs formatting",
    "color": "EEEEEE"
  },
  "CHECKS": {
    "prefixes": ["fix: ", "feat: "],
    "regexp": "docs\\(v[0-9]\\): ",
    "regexpFlags": "i",
    "ignoreLabels" : ["dont-check-PRs-with-this-label", "meta"]
  },
  "MESSAGES": {
    "success": "All OK",
    "failure": "Failing CI test",
    "notice": ""
  }
}
```
You can pass in one of `prefixes` or `regexp` or even both based on your use case. `regexpFlags` and `ignoreLables` are optional fields.

If `LABEL.name` is set to `""`, adding or removing labels will be skipped. The CI test will continue to pass/fail accordingly.

If none of the checks pass, a label will be added to that pull request. \
If at least one of them passes, the label will be removed.

This action causes CI tests to fail by default. However, if you do not want CI tests failing just because of this action, simply set `alwaysPassCI` as true in the CHECKS field. **An invalid config file will always cause the action to fail.**

Also, adding label names to the optional `ignoreLabels` field will forfeit any checks for PRs with those labels.

#### Create Workflow file

Create a workflow (eg: `.github/workflows/pr-title-checker.yml` see [Creating a Workflow file](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file)) to utilize the pr-title-checker action with content:

```yaml
name: "PR Title Checker"
on:
  pull_request_target:
    types:
      - opened
      - edited
      - synchronize
      - labeled
      - unlabeled

jobs:
  check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: thehanimo/pr-title-checker@v1.3.7
        with:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          pass_on_octokit_error: false
          configuration_path: ".github/pr-title-checker-config.json"
```
NOTE:
* [`pull_request_target`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request_target) event trigger should be used (not [`pull_request`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request)) in order to support checking PRs from forks. This was added in `v1.3.2`. See [#8](https://github.com/thehanimo/pr-title-checker/issues/8).
* `pass_on_octokit_error` is an optional input which defaults to false. Setting it to true will prevent the CI from failing when an octokit error occurs. This is useful when the environment this action is run in is not consistent. For e.g, it could be a missing GITHUB_TOKEN. Thanks to [@bennycode](https://github.com/bennycode) for pointing this out.

* `configuration_path` is also an optional input which defaults to `".github/pr-title-checker-config.json"`. If you wish to store your config file elsewhere, pass in the path here.
